This project is something I created for personal use.

I made use of the following resources when creating this project:

-  [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) from Processing
-  [pronouncing.js](https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingjs) by Allison Parrish (@aparrish)
-  [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict?in=C+M+U+dictionary&stress=-s)
